## Styling Directions
Use any appropriate selectors and property-value pairs to style the web pages and elements. Keep in mind the cascade, specificity, and inheritance as you apply properties to the various elements.

1. Open the `main.css` file from the `css` folder.
2. Create a color scheme of your choosing defining colors for the following: a dark color, a light color, an accent color, a button color, and a shadow color.
3. Style the header element as follows:
   1. Make the element a flex container by changing the `display`.
   2. Change the flex direction to be `column`.
   3. Justify the content so there is space between the items.
4. Style the footer element as follows:
   1. Make the element a flex container by changing the `display`.

   6. Add the light color to the text.
   7. Reduce the font size to be `.85em`.
   8. Add a top and bottom padding of `1rem`. *TIP: REM is used here because the font size of the element was reduced and EM would make it equal to the reduced font size.*
   9. Make the paragraphs into flex containers with a column direction.
   10. Give a width of `15em` to the paragraphs.
   11. Add a left and right margin of `1rem` to the paragraphs.

5. Save and apply a commit to the file.
6. Style the product card element as follows:
   1. Add the light color to the background.
   2. Add the dark color to the text.
   3. Add a box shadow that move `3px` to the left and down, a `6px` blur radius, and the shadow color.

   6. Add a margin of `1em` to all sides.
   7. Add a border radius of `.5em`.
7. Style the product card image element as follows:
   1. Change the display to be `block`.
   2. Set the width to be `100%` of the container.
   3. Add a top left and top right border radius to match the container's radius.
   4. Add a solid `2px` bottom border using the dark color.
8. Save and apply a commit to the file.
9. Style the product info as follows:
   1. Add a top and bottom margin of `.5rem`.
   2. Add a top and bottom padding of `.25rem` and a left and right padding of `.75rem`.
   3. Convert the element to a flex container with a column flex direction.
   4. Align the heading to the center of the container.
   5. Change the font size of the heading to `1.3rem` and add a line height of `1.5`.
10. Style the product id element as follows:
   1. Change the font size to `.75rem`.
   2. Apply a bottom padding of `.5rem`.
   3. Set the width to be equal to the `max-content`.
   4. Self align to the flex end.
11. Style the price element as follows:
    1. Change the font size to `1.1rem`.
    2. Apply the accent color to the text.
    3. Apply a bold font weight.

    5. Add a bottom padding of `.75rem`.
    6. Create a selector to target the `::before` pseudo-element and add the `content` property with a value of `"$ "`. *TIP: This will make the dollar symbol appear before the price, which can help to be able to programmatically change the price of a product and not worry about the currency symbol. And you can change this `content` value if the site loads in other localities and countries.*
